An implementation of the Compressed Quadtree and Skip Quadtree data structures to support approximate nearest neighbour searches as described in the following paper: 

Eppstein, D., Goodrich, M. T., Sun, J. Z. (2008) The Skip Quadtree: A Simple Dynamic Data Structure for Multidimensional Data, Int. Journal on Computational Geometry and Applications, 18(1/2), pp. 131 - 160

As implemented, this is not competitive with kd-trees.

To do: 
* Change knn to use linked list rather than vector for results.
