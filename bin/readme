To show correctness of an implementation, use ann-knn to make a reference file, e.g. 
./ann-knn ../tests/data/pts10000.txt ../tests/data/knn10000.txt > ann
./cqt-knn ../tests/data/pts10000.txt ../tests/data/knn10000.txt > cqt
diff cqt ann

If the files match, no output will be shown.

To time a search, use the built in bash time command, e.g.
time ./sqt-knn ../tests/data/pts10000.txt ../tests/data/knn10000.txt > /dev/null 

To display the generated compressed or skip quadtree, use:
./sqt-render-tree ../tests/data/pts50.txt tree.ps or ./cqt-render-tree ../tests/data/pts50.txt tree.ps
